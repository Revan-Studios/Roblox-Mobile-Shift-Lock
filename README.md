# Roblox-Mobile-Shift-Lock
A Roblox mobile shift lock script!

# How to use?

Its quite simple to use you would first need to make a gui for shift lock and then paste two things in it, one which is a local script and the other is a imagebutton. Withing the image button insert another script and paste "ShiftLockGUI.lua" in it. and for the script you made in the beginning paste "main.lua" in it!
